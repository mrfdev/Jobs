# Jobs

Extra handy information, resources, FAQ, help, etc pages for the zrips jobs-reborn plugin

## Resources

You will find some resources here, maybe I will share some custom jobs, custom configurations, some shell scripts that I might use, or some FAQ entries. It's worth a look, if you want me to host some stuff let me know.
